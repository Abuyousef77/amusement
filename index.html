      <h2>Type of Ride: Pendulum Ride</h2>
      <p>A single stationary tower is attached to a base, or portable trailer with outriggers. Attached to the stationary tower is a swinging arm that moves with the push of a 64KW drive motor. Fixed to both sides of the swinging arm is an opposite propulsion conduction system via two drive shafts that run from the connection point of the stationary tower and swinging arm, to the connection point where the swinging arm attaches to the passenger gondola, which keep the passenger gondola upright. On the other end of the swinging arm is a counter weight, usually with the ride's name as an illuminated sign fixed to it.</p>

        For the vertically challenged. A carousel (American English: from French carrousel and Italian carosello), roundabout (British English),[1] or merry-go-round, is an amusement ride consisting of a rotating circular platform with seats for riders. The "seats" are traditionally in the form of rows of wooden horses or other animals mounted on posts, many of which are moved up and down by gears to simulate galloping, to the accompaniment of looped circus music.[citation needed] This leads to one of the alternative American names, the galloper. Other popular names are jumper, horseabout and flying horses.

      For medium height people. Margherite Ottaviano, a 33-year-old Staten Island native, came to that same conclusion years ago, watching from the sidelines every summer as her brothers hopped on board.

      “I try to psych myself up for it, but I always chicken out when I hear that clicking,” she says. “I have that image of people walking down the track in my brain. Every summer there would be that clip on the news.”

      She may be exaggerating, but there have been tragic accidents over the years. A rider died in 2007 after snapping his neck on the ride. And just this March, the ride’s former operator was forced to pay a woman $600,000 for “serious, severe and permanent injuries” to her head and neck.

      This ride is for taller individuals. Kingda Ka is a steel accelerator roller coaster located at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey, United States. It is the world's tallest roller coaster, the world's second fastest roller coaster, and was the second strata coaster ever built. It was built by Stakotra,[1] a subcontractor to Intamin.

      The train is launched by a hydraulic launch mechanism to 128 miles per hour (206 km/h) in 3.5 seconds.[2] At the end of the launch track, the train climbs the main top hat tower, reaching a height of 456 feet (139 m) and spanning over a 3,118-foot-long (950 m) track by the end of the ride
